## 1) A case study (region of interest): 
### Determination of Areas for the Container Houses Neighbourhoods To Mitigate the Effects of the 6 February Earthquake


## 2) Aim and objectives:
#### The aim of this project is:
To improve the living conditions and increase the resilience of earthquake victims in the 6 March Türkiye earthquake by identifying suitable locations for container house neighbourhoods.

#### The objectives of this project are:

* To identify the areas affected by the 6 March Türkiye earthquake using satellite imagery and ground surveys.
* To assess the suitability of potential locations for container house districts based on factors such as slope, soil type, accessibility, and proximity to essential services.
* To assess the capacity of these areas to accommodate the number of earthquake victims in need of housing.
* To create a spatial database of potential container house neighborhood sites in QGIS, including information on site characteristics and suitability.
* To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using container houses compared to traditional tent-based solutions.
* To develop a decision support system using QGIS tools to assist in the selection of optimal container house neighborhood sites.
* To prioritize sites based on criteria such as population density, vulnerability, and need for housing, and to recommend the most suitable sites for the implementation of container house neighborhoods.
* To evaluate the effectiveness of the container house neighborhood approach in improving the living conditions and increasing the resilience of earthquake victims in the 6 March Türkiye earthquake.
* To promote the long-term sustainability and integration of the earthquake survivor sites, ensure that the affected population is empowered and supported to recover from the earthquake and rebuild their lives more comfortably.

## 3) Requirements:
### The main requirements of this project are:
1) Collection of data on terrain, structures, population density, roads, water resources and other geographical features in the earthquake area.
2) Meeting computer hardware and software requirements for the installation and use of QGIS software.
3) Determination of suitable areas in the earthquake zone, analysis of these areas according to factors such as security, infrastructure, environmental conditions, access, etc.
4) Planning the areas where the container houses will be placed, the size of the areas, the distance between them, the determination of the access roads.
5) Mapping of the project in line with the plans made and determined areas.
6) Obtaining or seeking funding sources necessary to finance the project.
7) Informing people living in the earthquake area about the benefits and use of container houses.
8) Designing and constructing container houses in accordance with earthquake risk.
9) Designing container houses as earthquake resistant, taking precautions such as fire safety and security cameras.
10) Determination of the people who will take part in the project, creation of the work schedule and budget, management of the project reporting and evaluation process.
